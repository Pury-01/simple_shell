This projects aims to polish our understanding on C programming language.
It entails:
     1. writing a Unix command line interpreter
The shell dispalys a prompt and waits for the user to type a command.
The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed
The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections
The command lines are made only of one word. No argument is passed to the program
If an executable cannot be found, the shell prints an error message and display the prompt again
The shell handles errors and "end of file" condition

     2. Handling command lines with arguments for the shell
     3. Handling the PATH
     4. Implementing the exit built-in that exits the shell
     5. Implementing the env built-in that prints the current environment
     6. Writing our own getline function
     7. Implement the setenv and unsetenv built commands
     8. Implementing the builtin command cd
     9. Handling the command separator ;
    10. Handling the && and || shell logical operators
    11. Implementing the alias builtin command
    12. Handling variable replacement: the $? and $$ variable
